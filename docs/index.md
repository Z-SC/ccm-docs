## Terms and Conditions

### Acknowledgment
**All work must acknowledge the CCM and reference the NSF grant number.**

Users should send the PI [jan.mandel@ucdenver.edu](mailto:jan.mandel@ucdenver.edu) copies of, and links to, all such
work published or posted. The below is the suggested attestation.

*"This work used the computing resources at the Center for Computational Mathematics, University of Colorado Denver,
including the Alderaan cluster, supported by the National Science Foundation award
[OAC-2019089](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019089)."* 

### Legal
**You (the user) are responsible for ensuring compliance to the data restrictions as outlined below. Failure to adhere
to these restrictions may result in account deactivation, and immediate deletion of any or all data.**

No export controlled technology or technical data related to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
or the International Traffic in Arms  Regulations (ITAR) is permitted on University of Colorado Denver Research
Computing resources. This includes export controlled data, export controlled software, and export controlled results
generated as output.

Do not keep any confidential or sensitive files on this system. In particular, no proprietary data, health records, 
grades, social security numbers, etc. If you use ssh keys to connect elsewhere from this system (such as github or 
another computer account), it is highly recommended to make an ssh key with a passcode.

All usage of this resource must be fundamental research, intended to be published with no restrictions or approval
requirement by the sponsor, or any restriction on the nationality of the participants.

### Storage
**All files stored on this cluster may be lost at any time with no notice. You (the user) must  maintain copies of all
important files elsewhere.** 

All users must keep their home directories under 25GB so that backup of all home directories is possible.
Additional project storage is available, which is not backed up. 
By default, files and directories, including your home directory, are created such that all other users have read
permissions. This is Linux default to encourage collaboration. If you want to keep a file or directory private from 
users other than system administrators, you need to manually change the permissions for that file or directory.
 To do so type the command below:

    chmod og-rwx file_or_directory_name

for more information on storage, see [link]

### How to contribute

If you would like to make a suggestion, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ccmucdenver/ccm-docs/issues/new/choose).
