**To protect the computer hardware, should Alderaan CPUs get too hot, the jobs running on them are 
suspended automatically. This should happen only rarely now. The jobs resume after the temperature drops, which 
should not take more than few minutes.**
Please see [CPU temperature](https://demo.openwfm.org/web/alderaan/cpu_temp.txt) for details.

### 2022/08/04

* 5pm: Maintenance completed, operations normal. 

* 10am: Maintenance started: continue moving nodes and cables improve air flow and adding fan strips.  Nodes math-alderann-c[01-12] will be powered off. Other nodes and functionality may be affected too.

* 12am: Nodes math-alderaan-c[01-12] are draining, no new jobs can start on them. Existing jobs can continue while the nodes remain up. Any nodes suspended automatically for CPU overheating will remain suspended until the maintenance is completed.

### 2022/08/02

* Maintenance (rack reconfiguration to improve cooling) is scheduled to continue 8/4 with nodes math-alderaan-c[01-12], which will be down. Other nodes may be affected for shorter periods.

* 8pm: Planned hardware maintenance completed. All alderaan nodes work normally. Please let me know if you see any issues.

* 9am: Planned maintenance in progress. Alderaan not available.

### 2022/07/31

* Nodes math-alderaan-c[29-32] fixed, math-alderaan-c[13-26,28] still offline.
  Slurm and temperature monitoring work with all available nodes normally,
  and the nodes can be used at full load. 

### 2022/07/30

* Nodes math-alderaan-c[13-26] and math-alderaan-c[28-32] are offline. 
  The slurm scheduler works with the remaining nodes normally. 
  Temperature monitoring works normally.

* Maintenance is scheduled to continue Tuesday 8/2/2022. 

### 2022/07/29 

* Maintenance of nodes math-alderaan-c[13-32] to improve cooling is planned for Friday 7/29 9am-3pm. 

* Please continue to run jobs, just know that they may be interrupted for maintenance. The downtime of individual nodes will be kept to a minimum possible. 

### 2022/07/28

* In preparation for maintenance on 7/29, nodes math-alderaan-c[13-32] are draining. The nodes will be resumed one by one as soon as possible.

* Thermal management was modified temporarily so that it does not resume suspended nodes (and jobs on them) automatically. Since the ambient temperature is low enough for nothing to get suspended, this is not expected to make a difference

### 2022/07/27

* Reconfiguration of slurm to recognize GPUs as a resource in progress. Please let me know should you see any unusual behavior. 

* The data center temperature is lower now. Job should not be getting suspended because of temperature any more, or only rarely.

* The cause of the downtime of math-alderaan-c[29-32] was found and it should be corrected by the end of the day Friday 7/29.

### 2022/07/21

* Node math-alderaan-c01 is back online. Nodes math-alderaan-c[29-32] are down, investigating. No jobs were cancelled.

* The [TDP](https://community.amd.com/t5/processors/what-do-amd-mean-by-tdp/td-p/221727) on math-alderaan-c01 and math-alderaan-c07 was changed. 
Their availability will be limited until testing is completed. 

### 2022/07/18

* Node math-alderaan-c01 is down.

### 2022/07/15 

* The high-memory/GPU nodes math-alderaan-h[01-02] are back in operation.

### 2022/07/14 

* The high memory/GPU nodes are down. Investigating.

* One way to avoid getting jobs suspended is to use fewer cores per node. Since the CPU turbo 
boost feature will speed up the remaining cores and the load depends on application, 
the number of cores per node to use is best determined by trial and error. 

### 2022/07/12

* To protect the computer hardware, jobs running on CPUs which get too hot are 
suspended automatically. The jobs resume after the temperature drops.

* We also increase the speed of 
the node fans proactively as the CPU temperatures increase.


### 2022/07/09

* Cooling and temperature monitoring were improved. **All Alderaan nodes can be used at 100% 
load safely.** 

* Should a [CPU temperature](https://demo.openwfm.org/web/alderaan/cpu_temp.txt)  exceed
a limit, the jobs using the CPU will be suspended automatically and  can be resumed later 
after a review of the situation. The node state will show as `drng` in the 
[partitions list](https://demo.openwfm.org/web/alderaan/sinfo.txt).

[//]: # (Reducing  the number of cores used has some effect on the CPU heat generated, but only a limited one because the remaining cores can boost their speed up.)

* A link to real-time CPU temperature on all Alderaan nodes was added above.

### 2022/07/08

* 1:15pm: Normal operations resumed. 

* 12:30pm: A/C offline, operations suspended.

* 11:00am: Data center was improved. Nodes math-alderaan-c[01-32] resumed. Please do go ahead and submit your jobs and use all  nodes at 100% again.

### 2022/07/07

* Because of CPU overhearing, no new jobs can start on nodes math-alderaan-c[01-32] and existing jobs on nodes loaded more than 80% were killed or suspended.
Arrangements to use the nodes at reduced load are possible while the heat situation is being resolved, please contact jan.mandel@ucdenver.edu.

* Node math-alderaan-c01 reset and returned to operations. 

### 2022/07/03

* Node math-alderaan-c01 failed and won't power on.

### 2022/06/21
* Thanks to all who submitted their contributions for the annual report for the [NSF grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019089) Alderaan is funded from!

* New modules available on Alderaan: module load intel will set up the Intel compiters and MPI; module load netcdf will point environment variable NETCDF to both C and Fortran NetCDF as expected by many software packages. Separate modules netcdf-c and netcdf-fortran are also available. All NetCDF modules are built with the Intel compilers.

### 2022/06/14 

* Slurm configuration with GPUs and memory as controlled resources is coming soon. In the meantime, **please do not request an entire high memory/GPU node if you do not need all the resources, request only the cores you need**.

* 1pm: Maintenance completed. Nodes math-alderaan-h01 and math-alderaan-h02 have two GPUS each now. Operations normal.

* 11am: Maintenance started, taking node math-alderaan-h01 offline.

### 2022/06/13

* The maintenance on math-alderaan-h01 and the return of math-alderaan-h02 are postponed to tomorrow 6/14 11am.

### 2022/06/12

* All jobs will be now suspended automatically when alderaan inlet temperature reaches 29 C to help prevent a data center overheating emergency.
Normal operations will resume when the temperature returns to at most 25 C. Please check the temperature log above if your jobs are suspended or submitted jobs do not start.

### 2022/06/11

* 9:40pm Temperature back to normal 25C, all jobs resumed, normal operations resumed. 

* 5pm Datacenter temperature 30C. All alderaan jobs suspended an no new jobs can start to help prevent overheating.

### 2022/06/10

* Node math-alderaan-h01 will be powered off Monday 6/13 afternoon to add a second GPU. All running jobs will be killed. The node will be put in draining state in 
advance so that no new jobs can start. Node math-alderann-h02 will be put  back, upgraded to two GPUs. Other nodes should not be affected.

* SLURM reconfiguration to allocate also GPUs and memory at least in the math-alderaan-gpu partition is coming soon.

* Forwarded from XSEDE: Texas A&M University **FASTER** (Fostering Accelerated Scientific Transformations, Education, and Research) is a novel composable high-performance data-analysis and computing instrument funded by the NSF MRI program. **FASTER** adopts the innovative Liqid composable software-hardware approach combined with cutting-edge technologies such as Intel Ice Lake CPUs, NVIDIA A100/A40/A30/A10/T4 GPUs, NVMe based storage, and high-speed Infiniband HDR interconnect. **FASTER** is a 184-node cluster built by Dell and has 40 A100, 200 T4, 8 A40, 8 A10, and 4 A30 GPUs. Each compute node can compose multiple GPUs of various types via Liqid PCIe fabrics. The **FASTER** platform removes significant bottlenecks in research computing by leveraging composable technology that can dynamically integrate disaggregated GPUs to a single node, allowing HPC/AI workflows to flexibly choose the type and number of GPUs to fit their needs. Thirty percent of **FASTER’s** computing resources are allocated to researchers nationwide by XSEDE/ACCESS program. **FASTER** is open as friendly user mode to XSEDE Startup allocations now and invites researchers who are interested in becoming **FASTER** users to submit allocation requests.
